## Presentation

People is a lightweight contact manager that store and organize informations about your contacts, customers, providers, etc...

The key principle of People are :

- Lightweight & user-friendly
- Extensible & exportable
- Customizable

### Lightweight

People is initially a contacts database, no more .Then you add plugins you want.

We want help you focus on your data, that's why People UI is designed to be minimalist, easy to use and without distraction.

### Extensible

People is an open-source software, that mean the source code is available. This allow other developpers arround the world to submit improvements and develop new plugins to increase People capabilities.

Because your data are yours, you can obviously export all your data at anytime. We also allow importing batch data.

### Customizable

As you better know what you need than us, you can define which informations you want to store about contacts, organizations, etc... And they can be of any type you want.

With plugins, People give you ability to build your own application, for your own needs. This let you choose for which features you want to pay or not. You don't have a pay for a lot of features you don't need.

# How the project works

This project is managed using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

ðŸ”Ž **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.** ([Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev/angular))

## Adding capabilities to the workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are some plugins which you can add to the workspace:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@people/mylib`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g [module|component|service|directive|etc...] my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new module, component, service, directive, etc...

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand the workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
